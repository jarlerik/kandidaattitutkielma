  abstract = {Agile methods and open source software communities share similar 
cultures with different approaches to overcome problems. Although several 
professionals are involved in both worlds, neither agile methodologies are as 
strong as they could be in open source communities nor those communities provide 
strong contributions to agile methods. This work identifies and exposes the 
obstacles that separate those communities in order to extract the best of them 
and improve both sides with suggestions of tools and development processes.}
